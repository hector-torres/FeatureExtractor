# Tweet NLP Categorizer

Takes data from a database of tweets from selected sources, then pre-processes them in order 
to run natural language processing tools in order to summarize them, categorize them, then 
parse out the most news-worthy events from these categories. 

The end result of this (in progress) research project is to have an output of news-worthy event 
summaries that is generated in real-time as tweets are produced.
